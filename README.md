# Cannonade_BikeShop_Segmentation
Project Description
Market Segmentation : Findings on Cannonade BikeShop Segmentation Analysis (GMM &amp; K-means)

Deploy the k-means & GMM algorithm to the Cannondale bikes data set to perform Market segmentation analysis. 
The example is taken from : http://www.business-science.io/business/2016/08/07/CustomerSegmentationPt1.html 

Tasks

- Determine the preferences of the bike shop segments by inspecting factors related to the model (e.g. price point, category of bike, etc.). 

- Combine cluster centroids with bike models for feature inspection. Then for each cluster, arrange the top 10 bike models by cluster in descending order and print out this information.

- Compare the segmentation findings from hard and soft assignment clustering model which are K-means and GMM Clustering.

Dataset

The dataset contains bicycle orders. The first data table bikes.xlsx contains information about various bike models. The second data table bikeshops.xlsx contains information about bike shops. The third data table orders.xlsx contains the actual order histories with the manufacturer Cannondale. Note, in orders.xlsx, customer.id refers to the IDs of bikeshops who ordered the bike and the product.id refers to the IDs of specific bike models.
